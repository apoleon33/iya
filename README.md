# Warning: WIP

Im not going to lie the algorithms are pretty lame (as well as the frontend and a bunch of other stuffs) at the moment so there is a big margin with what can be done and where we are at the moment

# TODO

- [ ] better-looking website
- [ ] website online
- [ ] way better algorithm

# Installation

Once the repository has been cloned:

You need to have [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) installed for preprocessing the css

```sh
make install
```

Then whenever you feel launching the server:

```sh
make all # if you have never preprocessed the sass
# or
make run
```
